# Stock_Market_Analysis_Project
In this project, I have executed a series of crucial steps to analyze and forecast stock market data. Here's a summary of the key accomplishments:

Data Collection: Collected relevant and reliable data from trusted sources to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted a comprehensive exploration of the collected data to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships. This step helped in gaining a deeper understanding of the underlying characteristics of the stock market.

Feature Engineering: Utilized two powerful techniques, Extra Tree and Random Forest Regression, to engineer meaningful features from the collected data. The Extra Tree method yielded particularly favorable results, indicating its effectiveness in extracting valuable information.

Stationarity Analysis: Performed stationarity analysis on the continuous data to ensure its suitability for further analysis. This step is crucial in time series analysis as it helps identify and address any non-stationary behavior in the data.

Model Building: Employed a diverse range of models including ARIMA, SARIMAX, Moving Average, Prophet, LSTM, Exponential Smoothing, and XGBoost. These models provide a comprehensive set of tools for forecasting stock market trends and prices. Notably, the XGBoost and LSTM models demonstrated strong performance, indicating their effectiveness in capturing the complex dynamics of the stock market.

Model Deployment: Successfully deployed the selected models for practical use. This step involved integrating the models into a real-world application, making them accessible and usable by stakeholders or end-users.

By executing these steps, this project has achieved a comprehensive analysis of stock market data, including data collection, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, model building utilizing various techniques, and the successful deployment of models for real-world applications. These accomplishments contribute to a deeper understanding of the stock market and provide valuable tools for forecasting and decision-making in stock trading and investment.
